        <h1>Lab 1 Information -</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience working with HTML, CSS, and publishing to your new website.
            In this assignment you will start to create your website that will be used during the semester.
            You will design a small 4 page website using HTML and CSS.<br />
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
            Web Design Background -<br />
            HTML - I have taken Introduction to Web Design and Cyberspace and Society courses at Temple University, both required creating simple html, or php websites to use client side scripting.<br />
            CSS - I have taken Introduction to Web Design and Cyberspace and Society courses at Temple University, both required creating websites using inline, internal, external styling.<br />
            Javascript - I have taken Introduction to Web Design and have designed simple scripts to perform calculations and perform client side actions for a website such as changing styles.<br />
            JQuery - I have taken Introduction to Web Design and have designed simple scripts to perform calculations and perform client side actions for a website such as an interactive image gallery.<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Advanced CSS Techniques -<br />
            Some advanced CSS techniques that I have employed in this lab is creating an interactive navigation bar which links to the other required pages for the assignment.<br />
            I have created a style sheet for monitors, and internal scripting for mobile viewing via @media screen using max-width.<br />
            I employed relative positioning for the body and to each child of the body except the footer which is fixed to the bottom of the window.<br />
            I have assigned box-sizing to border-box to the body and all children of the body.<br />
            I have employed display to stack my navigation bar vertically or horizontally depending on window size.<br />
            I employed pseudo classes such as hover and visited for my navigation bar.<br />
        </p>
        <br />

            Opinions on Lab - <br />
            This lab served as a way for me to reinforce the knowledge I had before taking this course.
            A good thing about the lab being assigned early is that I can adapt some of the lecture onto the lab such as mobile optimization and monitor optimization.
            I like that with this lab I had to start from scratch, this basically means that I have full knowledge of everything I have implemented into this lab which I explained in the earlier paragraph regarding the CSS techniques I employed.<br />
